// use it for this

// have the service iterate through a hardcoded list to create the teams for the season
// once that's finished...

// iterate through the file, saving score
// take note of which week is skipped for each team; save that as the bye week
// check if all bye weeks recorded for that season

// It should be relatively easy to write a rule to check if/when team names, locations should be changed.

// teams = {"ARI", "ATL", "BAL", "BUF", "CAR", "CHI", "CIN", "CLE", "DAL", "DEN",

//     "TEN", "WAS"}
