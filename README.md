# Fantasy Golfball
Alternatively, Fantasy Football with Golf Scoring (lowest score wins)

## But why?
Fantasy Golfball is a proof of concept fantasy football creation that is meant to ultimately be able to host a service for those that want to play fantasy football with a quirky, irreverent ruleset.

## Technologies Used
- React/JS, C#/.NET, CSS
- xUnit, Moq
- EFC
- PSQL
- SignalR
- Context API

## Where is the project at now and where is it going?
Functionality is being added and tested for MVP mandatory features. Pending that testing and functionality, in-house testing with a group of beta testers will begin. After that, the project will continue development with an eye on becoming a public-facing web service.

## MVP statement
Minimum Viable Product will be achieved when users can do the following:
1. Create an account and join or create one or more leagues with other users,
2. Enter into a live draft with those users to select players for their roster,
3. Add, drop, and trade said players with other users,
4. Set active and benched players on their roster,
5. See their matchups with other users and the results of the matchup after time has passed.

## Disclosures
I don't own football (does anybody?). All data used is either fabricated for testing purposes or gathered from public sources on the internet. I do not profit from this project.
