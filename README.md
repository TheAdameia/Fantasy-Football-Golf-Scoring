Alternatively, Fantasy Football with Golf Scoring (lowest score wins)
https://fantasygolfball.org

## But why?
Fantasy Golfball is a fantasy football webapp for those that want to play fantasy football with a quirky, irreverent ruleset. It is currently in alpha testing following completion of MVP features.

## Technologies Used
- React/JS, C#/.NET, CSS
- xUnit, Moq
- EFC, PSQL
- SignalR
- Context API
- nginx, certbot, cloudflare

## Where is the project at now and where is it going?
Fantasy Golfball is currently in an alpha state, using fake player and scoring data to test the validity of business logic and user experience. Users have the option of accelerating a season using custom timeframes (i.e., a "week" can pass in a day instead of a real time week). Major beta planned features include the addition of past seasons of real NFL fantasy data so that users can recreate those seasons on their own time.

## MVP statement
Minimum Viable Product means that users can do the following:
1. Create an account and join or create one or more leagues with other users,
2. Enter into a live draft with those users to select players for their roster,
3. Add and drop said players to the user's roster,
4. Set active and benched players on their roster,
5. See their matchups with other users and the results of the matchup after time has passed.

## Disclosures
I don't own football (does anybody?). All data used is either fabricated for testing purposes or gathered from public sources on the internet. I do not profit from this project.
