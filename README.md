# Fantasy Golfball
Alternatively, Fantasy Football with Golf Scoring (lowest score wins)

## But why?
Fantasy Golfball is a proof of concept fantasy football creation that is meant to ultimately be able to host a service for those that want to play fantasy football with a quirky, irreverent ruleset.

## Technologies Used
- React/JS
- C#/.NET
- EFC
- PSQL
- reactstrap
- Context API
- CSS
- SignalR

## Where is the project at now and where is it going?
Functionality is being added and tested for MVP mandatory features. Pending that testing and functionality, in-house testing with a group of beta testers will begin. After that, the project will continue development with an eye on becoming a public-facing web service.

## Disclosures
I don't own football (does anybody?). All data used is either fabricated for testing purposes or gathered from public sources on the internet. I do not profit from this project.
